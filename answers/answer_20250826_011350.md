Short answer
- Outbound connections: None active. netscan shows no ESTABLISHED TCP sessions; only LISTENING or CLOSED entries at capture time [Source 684], [Source 685].
- Listening ports of interest and owners:
  - Simple TCP/IP Services enabled (uncommon on workstations): TCPSVCS.EXE (PID 1416) listening on TCP/UDP 7 (Echo), 9 (Discard), 13 (Daytime), 17 (QOTD), 19 (Chargen) [Source 684], [Source 685]. Command line confirms tcpsvcs.exe [Source 683].
  - Windows Media Player Network Sharing: wmpnetwk.exe (PID 1856) listening on TCP 554 (RTSP) and UDP 5004/5005 (RTP/RTCP) [Source 684]. Loopback TCP entries are CLOSED (not active) [Source 684].
  - Peer networking: svchost.exe (PID 2368, -k LocalServicePeerNet) listening TCP 3587 and UDP 3540 [Source 684], [Source 683].
  - File/print sharing: System (PID 4) listening TCP 445 and 139; UDP 137/138 [Source 684], [Source 685].
  - RPC/management:
    - svchost.exe (PID 720, -k RPCSS) TCP 135 [Source 685], [Source 683].
    - Dynamic RPC endpoints: wininit.exe PID 424 TCP 49152; svchost.exe PID 816 TCP 49153; lsass.exe PID 492 TCP 49154; svchost.exe PID 876 TCP 49155; services.exe PID 484 TCP 49156 [Source 684], [Source 685], [Source 683].
  - UPnP/WSD/SSDP/Discovery:
    - System (PID 4) TCP 2869 (UPnP) and 5357 (WSD) [Source 684], [Source 685].
    - svchost.exe (PID 1372, -k LocalServiceAndNoImpersonation) UDP 1900 (SSDP) and multiple WS-Discovery 3702 listeners across svchost instances [Source 684], [Source 685], [Source 683].
    - svchost.exe (PID 1044, -k NetworkService) UDP 5355 (LLMNR) [Source 684], [Source 683].

Notes
- One odd carved entry shows svchost.exe (PID 1044) with a TCPv6 peer 4800:ca00:80fa:ffff:4800:ca00:80fa:ffff, but its state is CLOSED, so not an active connection and likely a memory artifact rather than live traffic [Source 685].
- The presence of TCPSVCS.EXE and RTSP (554) on a workstation is atypical and increases attack surface, even if not malicious by itself [Source 684], [Source 683].

Next steps
- Run windows.sockscan to carve additional sockets and validate no hidden ESTABLISHED connections.
- Use windows.services (or svcscan) to confirm Simple TCP/IP Services (simptcp) and WMP sharing service states and start types; disable if unnecessary.
- Dump and verify tcpsvcs.exe and wmpnetwk.exe modules (hash/signature) from their PIDs.
- Review firewall rules and recent connections (e.g., netscan again after filtering for ESTABLISHED) to assess exposure over time.

Short answer: Yes.

Suspicious/unusual items observed
- svchost.exe -k secsvcs (PID 948): This host runs multiple standard svchost groups (DcomLaunch, RPCSS, netsvcs, LocalService*, NetworkService, imgsvc). The “secsvcs” group stands out as non-standard on this system and may indicate a rogue service group configured to load a malicious service DLL. [Source 2c81df031b848ea0ac407f06a9429add34f5e5c8 | windows.cmdline | chunk 0]
- tcpsvcs.exe (PID 1416): Simple TCP/IP Services (tcpsvcs.exe) is rarely enabled on modern Windows systems. Its presence is unusual and worth verifying, as these simple services (echo/daytime/etc.) are sometimes abused. [Source 2c81df031b848ea0ac407f06a9429add34f5e5c8 | windows.cmdline | chunk 0]

Noteworthy but not inherently suspicious (contextual)
- DumpIt.exe (PID 796): Memory acquisition tool likely responsible for this capture. [Source be50b9f36b5d72d1871ca6b72e31e82ebfa1705c | windows.cmdline | chunk 1]
- cmd.exe (PID 1984): Present with no visible arguments; may be benign user activity, but worth checking for associated console history. [Source be50b9f36b5d72d1871ca6b72e31e82ebfa1705c | windows.cmdline | chunk 1]
- psxss.exe (PID 376): POSIX/SUA subsystem service; uncommon on typical endpoints. Insufficient context to classify; verify installation status and binary. [Source 92c0778645706d1a1eac074c1bb435def13dde0f | windows.pslist | chunk 0 and Source 2c81df031b848ea0ac407f06a9429add34f5e5c8 | windows.cmdline | chunk 0]

Next steps
- Enumerate services and service groups; identify “secsvcs” details (service name, ImagePath/ServiceDLL). Volatility: windows.services (or svcscan). 
- Inspect DLLs loaded by svchost PID 948. Volatility: windows.dlllist -p 948.
- Check for code injection in svchost PID 948. Volatility: windows.malfind -p 948 and windows.ldrmodules -p 948.
- Verify tcpsvcs.exe service configuration and network listeners. Volatility: windows.services and windows.netscan.
- Recover command history/output for cmd.exe. Volatility: windows.cmdscan and windows.consoles.

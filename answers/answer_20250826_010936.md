Answer:
Yes. mspaint.exe was running (PID 2424). The executable path referenced is:
- C:\Windows\system32\mspaint.exe [Source 683], also shown as the loaded image in dlllist [Source 731].

No other drawing applications are indicated in the provided context, and no image/document file paths opened by Paint are visible in these excerpts.

Citations:
- mspaint.exe in cmdline with its full path and PID 2424 [Source 683].
- mspaint.exe listed in dlllist with module path C:\Windows\system32\mspaint.exe [Source 731].

Next steps:
- Run windows.handles -p 2424 to enumerate files mspaint.exe had open (e.g., .bmp/.png/.jpg).
- Run windows.filescan and filter for common image extensions to spot candidate files.
- Run windows.registry.printkey for HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Applets\Paint\Recent File List to identify recently opened files.
- Run windows.vadinfo or windows.yarascan -p 2424 searching for image-path strings (e.g., “.bmp”, “.png”, “Recent File List”).

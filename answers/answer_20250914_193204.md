Yes. KeePass Password Safe 2 was running:
- KeePass.exe (PID 3008) with command line: "C:\Program Files (x86)\KeePass Password Safe 2\KeePass.exe" "C:\Users\SmartNet\Secrets\Hidden.kdbx" [Source f2ec3cab6215e9f90cc428d8071a52bbc3b61d52]
- DLL list confirms the KeePass.exe process and its loaded modules (PID 3008) [Source fac8b5485d0d5d133b84c7cd0d4eb21c1d5d87f2]

Note: notepad.exe (PID 3260) had the Hidden.kdbx file open, but Notepad is not a password manager [Source f2ec3cab6215e9f90cc428d8071a52bbc3b61d52].

Next steps:
- Run windows.pslist/windows.pstree to confirm KeePass.exe parentage and timeline.
- Run windows.handles -p 3008 to verify the Hidden.kdbx file handle.
- Dump KeePass.exe memory (windows.memdump/procdump -p 3008) and analyze strings/yarascan for potential keys or credentials.
- Check windows.netscan to see if KeePass (or plugins) made any network connections.

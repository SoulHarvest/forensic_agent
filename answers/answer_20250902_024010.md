Short answer:
- Recently created archive files: Yes — a RAR archive was found at Users\Alissa Simpson\Documents\Important.rar [Source bd9421ce8d28a2d15d7804ce401adcd3bb22fc8b]. This is consistent with WinRAR.exe running shortly before acquisition (PID 1512, started 2019-12-11T14:37:23+00:00) [Source 702827e939fd6a3b74a66a3f8307b8c18982ecf2], and WinRAR artifacts (Program Files\WinRAR\WinRAR.exe and WinRAR\version.dat) present in memory [Source bd9421ce8d28a2d15d7804ce401adcd3bb22fc8b].
- Deleted file records: Not determinable from the provided filescan output. The listings don’t include NTFS deletion flags or timestamps, so we cannot confirm any deleted entries from this context.

Details:
- Evidence of archiving activity:
  - WinRAR.exe active: PID 1512, start 2019-12-11T14:37:23+00:00 [Source 702827e939fd6a3b74a66a3f8307b8c18982ecf2]
  - Archive path observed: Users\Alissa Simpson\Documents\Important.rar [Source bd9421ce8d28a2d15d7804ce401adcd3bb22fc8b]
  - WinRAR present/used: Program Files\WinRAR\WinRAR.exe and Users\Alissa Simpson\AppData\Roaming\WinRAR\version.dat [Source bd9421ce8d28a2d15d7804ce401adcd3bb22fc8b]
- Deleted records: No explicit deleted MFT entries are shown in the provided excerpts; filescan alone doesn’t confirm deletion status.

Next steps:
- Run windows.mftscan (and/or mftparser) to enumerate FILE records, identify deleted entries, and obtain timestamps for Important.rar and other archives.
- Use windows.handles -p 1512 (WinRAR PID) to see if WinRAR had Important.rar or source files open at capture time.
- Attempt extraction with windows.dumpfiles targeting the Important.rar object to recover the archive from memory.
- Build a timeline (windows.timeliner) to correlate WinRAR process start with file creation/modification events.

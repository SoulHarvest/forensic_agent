Short answer: No clearly malicious process/command line stands out, but several items are unusual and warrant follow-up.

Notable/suspicious or uncommon entries (with rationale)
- svchost.exe (PID 948) with group “-k secsvcs”: The “secsvcs” service group is uncommon on typical Windows client builds; confirm what services are hosted here and their image paths/signatures. [Source 683]
  Line: 948 svchost.exe  C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe -k secsvcs
- TCPSVCS.EXE (PID 1416): Simple TCP/IP Services are rarely enabled on modern systems; verify if legitimately required. Attackers sometimes enable legacy/auxiliary services for persistence or misuse. [Source 683]
  Line: 1416 TCPSVCS.EXE  C:\Windows\System32\tcpsvcs.exe
- psxss.exe (PID 376): POSIX subsystem service is uncommon on most Windows 7+ hosts unless Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications/SUA was installed. Validate necessity and image authenticity. [Source 683]
  Line: 376 psxss.exe  %SystemRoot%\system32\psxss.exe
- cmd.exe (PID 1984): Interactive shell present; could be benign user/admin activity, but check associated console history to rule out hands-on-keyboard abuse. [Source 683]
  Line: 1984 cmd.exe  "C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe"
- WinRAR.exe (PID 1512) opening “Important.rar”: Possibly benign, but the filename could be lure-themed; verify content and any subsequent spawned processes. [Source 683]
  Line: 1512 WinRAR.exe  "C:\Program Files\WinRAR\WinRAR.exe" "C:\Users\Alissa Simpson\Documents\Important.rar"
- DumpIt.exe (PID 796): Memory acquisition tool; expected during triage, not an indicator of compromise. [Source 683]
  Line: 796 DumpIt.exe  "C:\Users\SmartNet\Downloads\DumpIt\DumpIt.exe"

Everything else (core OS processes, svchost groups like DcomLaunch/RPCSS/netsvcs/imgsvc, WMP Network Service, Search components, VirtualBox services, Explorer/DWM, MSPaint) appears consistent with a normal Windows environment. [Source 683]

Next steps
- Enumerate hosted services for PID 948: windows.svcscan or windows.svclist; map to -k secsvcs and confirm image paths/signatures.
- Check network activity/ports of TCPSVCS and the “secsvcs” svchost: windows.netscan or windows.netstat.
- Inspect memory of the unusual processes (svchost PID 948, TCPSVCS, psxss) for injections: windows.malfind, windows.ldrmodules.
- Review console history and typed commands: windows.cmdscan and windows.consoles (correlate with cmd.exe PID 1984).
- Cross-validate process legitimacy: windows.psxview, windows.getsids, windows.dlllist for the listed PIDs.

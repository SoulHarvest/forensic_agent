Suspicious/odd processes observed

- svchost.exe (PID 948) — command line “C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe -k secsvcs”
  - Reason: The service group “secsvcs” is not a standard Windows 7/Server 2008 R2 svchost group (common ones include DcomLaunch, RPCSS, netsvcs, etc.). Malware sometimes creates custom svchost groups to blend in. Investigate what service(s) are hosted under this group. [Source 683], [Source 682]

- TCPSVCS.EXE (PID 1416) — “C:\Windows\System32\tcpsvcs.exe”
  - Reason: Simple TCP/IP Services is an optional/legacy component and is rarely enabled on workstations. If not expected, its presence is suspicious and it exposes simple network services that could be abused. Confirm whether this feature was intentionally enabled. [Source 683], [Source 682]

- psxss.exe (PID 376) — “%SystemRoot%\system32\psxss.exe”
  - Reason: POSIX/SUA subsystem service; uncommon on default Windows installations. Presence may indicate the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications was installed, or could be abused as a masquerade point. Validate whether SUA/Subsystem components are expected. [Source 683], [Source 682]

Potentially noteworthy but not inherently malicious

- cmd.exe (PID 1984) with conhost.exe (PID 2692)
  - Reason: Interactive shell usage can be abused by attackers, but could also be normal user/admin activity (e.g., preceding DumpIt execution). Context unclear. [Source 683], [Source 682]

- wmpnetwk.exe (PID 1856)
  - Reason: Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service. Not always enabled; network-facing. Flag only if unexpected in this environment. [Source 683], [Source 682]

- WinRAR.exe (PID 1512) handling “C:\Users\Alissa Simpson\Documents\Important.rar”
  - Reason: User activity likely, but archives can be used to stage payloads/exfiltration. Review archive contents if incident-driven. [Source 683], [Source 682]

LOLbins and odd paths

- No classic LOLBins observed (e.g., powershell.exe, wmic.exe, certutil.exe, mshta.exe, regsvr32.exe, rundll32.exe). [Source 683]
- Executable paths generally reside in system locations (System32, Program Files). No executions from Temp/AppData or other atypical user-writable locations observed. Notable user-space executions (likely benign in context): DumpIt.exe from a user Downloads folder and WinRAR.exe opening a user Documents archive. [Source 683]

Next steps

- Map services to processes: run windows.svcscan or windows.svclist and inspect the “secsvcs” group membership and the service(s) hosted by PID 948; verify service binaries/paths. 
- Network review: run windows.netscan to see if tcpsvcs.exe (PID 1416) is listening and on which ports; assess for unexpected exposure.
- Module and injection checks: run windows.dlllist/ldrmodules and windows.malfind against svchost.exe (PID 948) and psxss.exe (PID 376).
- Persistence/registry: check HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Svchost for a “secsvcs” group (windows.registry.printkey) and verify associated service ImagePath values (windows.svcscan details).
- Integrity/signing: use windows.verinfo and hash the on-disk binaries for svchost group members, psxss.exe, and tcpsvcs.exe; compare to known-good.

Answer
Likely cause: Archiving with WinRAR using an option that removes source files after creating the archive. WinRAR.exe was actively running just minutes before the memory acquisition (PID 1512, started 2019-12-11 14:37:23 UTC), which aligns with the system time at capture (14:38:00) and suggests recent user file operations. WinRAR has a “Delete files after archiving” feature that would result in apparent file loss. [Source 702827e939fd6a3b74a66a3f8307b8c18982ecf2], [Source 1c68ada9d7aeb11044fa8370b09b622839e56a0a]

Confidence and limitations
- This is a plausible hypothesis based on the presence and timing of WinRAR.exe; the provided context does not show WinRAR’s command-line arguments or specific file handles, so we cannot confirm deletion definitively from the current data. [Source 2c81df031b848ea0ac407f06a9429add34f5e5c8]

Next steps
- Volatility windows.handles -p 1512 and windows.dlllist -p 1512 to identify files WinRAR had open and any archive targets.
- Volatility windows.cmdline for PID 1512 specifically (if not fully captured) to recover WinRAR arguments (e.g., switches implying deletion).
- Volatility windows.filescan to locate deleted file records or recently created archive files in memory-resident structures.
- Volatility windows.mftparser (if available) to look for deleted MFT entries tied to WinRAR’s timestamp window.
- Dump WinRAR process memory (windows.memmap + procdump) and string-search for archive paths/switches indicating “delete after archiving.”

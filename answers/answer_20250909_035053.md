Preliminary assessment (based only on provided outputs):

Suspicious
- svchost.exe (PID 948) with -k secsvcs
  - Command line: C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe -k secsvcs [Source 2c81df031b848ea0ac407f06a9429add34f5e5c8]
  - Rationale: “secsvcs” is not a standard Windows 7/Server 2008 R2 svchost service group (common groups include DcomLaunch, RPCSS, LocalServiceNetworkRestricted, LocalSystemNetworkRestricted, netsvcs, etc.). Custom groups are often used by malware to masquerade under svchost.

- tcpsvcs.exe (PID 1416)
  - Command line: C:\Windows\System32\tcpsvcs.exe [Source 2c81df031b848ea0ac407f06a9429add34f5e5c8]
  - Rationale: Simple TCP/IP Services are disabled by default and rarely used; when present they can expose auxiliary ports and have been abused by attackers.

Noteworthy but not inherently malicious
- psxss.exe (PID 376) [Sources 2c81df031b848ea0ac407f06a9429add34f5e5c8, 92c0778645706d1a1eac074c1bb435def13dde0f]
  - POSIX/SUA subsystem server. Legitimate if the feature is installed, but uncommon on typical endpoints.
- Multiple interactive sessions (second set of csrss/winlogon/dwm/explorer, e.g., PIDs 2760/2808/3004/2504) suggests more than one logged-on session; not suspicious by itself [Source be50b9f36b5d72d1871ca6b72e31e82ebfa1705c].
- DumpIt.exe (PID 796) indicates memory acquisition; expected in this context [Source be50b9f36b5d72d1871ca6b72e31e82ebfa1705c].

Caveats
- Determination is based solely on cmdline/pslist fragments. Confirmation requires service enumeration, image paths, and network/socket context.

Next steps
- Run windows.svcscan and enumerate services/groups; specifically verify if a “secsvcs” Svchost group exists and what services/DLLs it loads.
- Query registry for Svchost groups: windows.registry.printkey on HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Svchost to confirm “secsvcs” definition and associated service names/Dll.
- Inspect the suspect processes: windows.dlllist and windows.malfind for svchost.exe (PID 948) and tcpsvcs.exe (PID 1416) to check loaded modules, image paths, signatures, and potential code injection.
- Check network activity: windows.netscan (or windows.netstat) to identify listening ports and map them to tcpsvcs.exe/svchost.exe.
- Review process tree/parents: windows.pstree and windows.psscan to confirm parentage and detect any hidden/terminated-but-resident processes tied to these PIDs.
